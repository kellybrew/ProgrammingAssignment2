## The function written below, makeCacheMatrix
## creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse
## The purpose of writing this fucntion is to cache potentially
## time-consuming computations
## The function makeCacheMatrix contains the following functions:
## * setMat       set the value of the matrix
## * getMat       get the value of the matrix
## * getCache     get the cached value
## * getInverse   get the cached value (inverse of the matrix)
## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
